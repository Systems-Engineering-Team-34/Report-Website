                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">Technology</h5>
                  <p>
                    Our development started with researching through the different tools we could use to create the survey system. A 
                    clear choice was suggested by our partners which was Twilio. Twilio [1] is a customer engagement platform used by over 
                    300,00 global enterprises to help build unique, personalized experiences for their customers. Twilio offers numerous 
                    benefits and unique advantages such as:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Wide Range of Communication Features: Twilio provides a comprehensive suite of communication APIs, including 
                      text, chat, in particualy integration of platforms such as WhatsApp.</li>
                    <li>Global Reach: Twilio's worldwide messaging capabilities make it an ideal choice for our project, which is 
                      designed to operate on a global scale.</li>

                      and secure handling of sensitive data, ensuring that our users' information is protected.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These benefits makes it clear that Twilio is the perfect match for our project and will integrate into our system 
                    very efficiently.</p>
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">WhatsApp</h5>
                  <p>With Twilio, it offers many different platforms it can integrate with such as WhatsApp and SMS. However, we have 
                    decided to use WhatsApp as our main platform for the survey tool. Here are some key benefits of using WhatsApp with 
                    Twilio [2]:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Higher Engagement Rates: WhatsApp boasts over 2 billion users worldwide, with high engagement rates in many 
                      countries. This widespread adoption can lead to better engagement and response rates compared to SMS.</li>
                    <li>Cost-Effectiveness: WhatsApp can be more cost-effective, especially for international messaging. While SMS may 
                      incur varying charges based on carrier rates and international fees, WhatsApp messages use the recipient's data 
                      plan, potentially reducing costs for both sender and recipient.</li>
                    <li>Security: WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption for all its messages, ensuring a higher level of security and 
                      privacy for sensitive communications.</li>
                    <li>Global Accessibility: WhatsApp is accessible on both smartphones and through web applications, ensuring users 
                      can receive and engage with messages even on desktop devices.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Choosing WhatsApp for communication within a Twilio-powered project can enhance user engagement, provide richer 
                    communication experiences, and offer cost and security advantages, making it a compelling option for global 
                    projects, such as our project.</p>
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">Language</h5>
                  <p>
                    Twilio offers a tool called Twilio Studio [3], which users can visually construct the flow of the survey, defining how users 
                    interact with the bot via WhatsApp, how the bot responds to various inputs, and how it manages the conversation's progression. 
                    This tool has many advantages such as the ease of use as well as the ability to create complex flows with minimal coding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, despite the convenience and intuitiveness of Twilio Studio, we chose to develop our survey bot using 
                    Python due to its powerful programming capabilities and seamless integration with our Django backend. Python's 
                    extensive libraries and Django's robust framework provide the flexibility needed to build a more customized and 
                    integrated survey solution, essential for our project's requirements. This approach allows for more sophisticated 
                    data handling, analysis, and integration with our system's other components, offering a deeper level of 
                    customization and control over the survey process.

                <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Front End</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">React</h5>
                  <p>When selecting the front-end technology for our project, we considered various frameworks and libraries before 
                    ultimately choosing React [4]. Here's an overview of the alternatives and why React stood out as the best choice:</p>
                  <p>Alternatives to React:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Angular: Angular is a comprehensive front-end framework that offers a wide range of features and tools for 
                      building complex web applications. However, there is a steep learning curve.</li>
                    <li>Vue.js: Vue.js is a lightweight and flexible front-end framework that provides a simple and intuitive 
                      development experience. While Vue.js is beginner-friendly, it might lack the scalability needed for more complex applications.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Why React? [5]</p>
                  <p>React's component-based architecture allows for the development of reusable UI components, promoting efficient 
                    code management and scalability. Its vast ecosystem provides a wealth of resources and libraries, making it an 
                    ideal choice for complex applications like ours. Furthermore, React's efficiency in rendering and updating the DOM 
                    ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, crucial for the interactive elements of our dashboard.</p>
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">Language</h5>
                  <p>For our project, we opted to use TypeScript over JavaScript. TypeScript offers several advantages in a React environment [6]:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Type Safety: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, which introduces static typing. It helps catch 
                      type-related errors during development, resulting in more reliable and maintainable code.</li>
                    <li>Scalability: For more complex projects, TypeScript's static typing can help prevent certain bugs and simplify 
                      refactoring code. It provides better code organization and documentation through interfaces, type annotations, 
                      and generics.</li>
                    <li>Performance: There is a faster performance with TypeScript when React is used with it as it is a type system. 
                      Typescript has static typing that helps the compiler make sure that the code is correct. On the other hand, in 
                      JavaScript, no errors are detected by the compiler because it’s dynamically typed. Moreover, Typescript has its own 
                      virtual DOM, which produces a faster UI.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">React Packages</h5>
                  <p>1. ApexCharts: We integrated ApexCharts with React to create dynamic and interactive charts and graphs. 
                    ApexCharts offers a wide range of chart types and is highly customizable, making it perfect for visualizing the 
                    diverse data collected from our surveys.</p>
                  <p>2. React Simple Maps: To implement the geographical selection of countries, we used React Simple Maps. This 
                    package simplifies the creation of SVG maps in React applications, offering interactivity and customization 
                    options like zooming and centering, ideal for our needs in representing global data.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div id="tab-back-end" class="container tab-pane"><br>
                <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Back End</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">Django, Python</h5>
                  <p>For the backend of our project, we chose Django [7] alongside Python, a combination renowned for its robustness and 
                    efficiency in web development. Django, a high-level Python web framework, facilitates rapid development and clean 
                    design, making it ideal for our needs, which include managing the interaction between Twilio and our database, as 
                    well as connecting the database to the frontend. While alternatives like Flask and Express.js were considered for 
                    their simplicity and flexibility, Django's comprehensive features as well as its versatility ultimately provided 
                    the most cohesive solution for our project's complexity.</p>
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">Database</h5>
                  <p>We selected MySQL as our database [8] of choice, valuing its reputation for reliability, robust performance, and 
                    user-friendliness. These attributes perfectly meet our project's demands for managing structured data and 
                    executing sophisticated queries. While the schema-less nature and adaptability of MongoDB, a NoSQL database, 
                    initially caught our attention for storing survey responses, the necessity for intricate queries and the 
                    preservation of data relationships guided us towards a unified MySQL solution. This ensures that all our data 
                    reside within a single, cohesive database environment, allowing for more intricate data analysis and integrity.</p>
                  <h5 class="text-decoration-underline">Hosting Service</h5>
                  <p>For hosting our backend and APIs, we chose Microsoft Azure [9] for its robust services and infrastructure, ideal for 
                    our project's needs including reliability and scalability. While we considered Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its 
                    scalability and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for its analytics and integration, Azure's compatibility with our 
                    technology stack, strong security measures, and seamless integration with Microsoft tools made it the preferred 
                    choice. Azure's comprehensive support ensures smooth deployment and operation of our Django-based backend, 
                    making it the optimal hosting environment for our project.</p>
